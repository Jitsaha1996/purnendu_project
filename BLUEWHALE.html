            The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed
            length
            of 29.9 meters (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest
            animal
            known to have ever existed. The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue
            dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the North
            Atlantic
            and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the
            Indian
            Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is also a population in the
            waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.

            In general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer feeding areas near the poles and their
            winter
            breeding grounds near the tropics. There is also evidence of year-round residencies, and partial or
            age/sex-based migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet consists almost exclusively of krill.
            They
            are generally solitary or gather in small groups, and have no well-defined social structure other than
            mother-calf bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25 Hz and the
            production of vocalizations may vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are their only
            natural
            predators.

            The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was
            hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all
            blue
            whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as
            endangered
            as of 2018. It continues to face numerous man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise and
            climate change.
