        <P>The British brought modern hotels to Kolkata. The Oldest was John Spence's Hotel. Spence's, the first ever hotel
            in Asia was opened to the public in 1830. The Great Eastern Hotel was established in 1840 or 1841 by David
            Wilson as the Auckland Hotel, named after George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland, then Governor General of India.
            Prior to opening the hotel, Wilson ran a bakery at the same site. The hotel opened with 100 rooms and a
            department store on the ground floor (Spence's Hotel, established in 1830 but no longer in existence, is
            considered to be the first major hotel in Calcutta). </P>
