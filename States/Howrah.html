        </h1>
        <p>Howrah Bridge is a bridge with a suspended span over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in
            1943, the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same
            location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed Rabindra Setu
            after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate. It is still
            popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.
    
            Eventually a contract was signed with Sir Bradford Leslie to construct a pontoon bridge. Different parts were
            constructed in England and shipped to Calcutta, where they were assembled. The assembling period was fraught
            with problems. The bridge was considerably damaged by the great cyclone on 20 March 1874. A steamer named Egeria
            broke from her moorings and collided head-on with the bridge, sinking three pontoons and damaging nearly 200
            feet of the bridge. The bridge was completed in 1874,[8] at a total cost of ?2.2 million,[16] and opened to
            traffic on 17 October of that year. The bridge was then 1528 ft. long and 62 ft. wide, with 7-foot wide
            pavements on either side</p>
