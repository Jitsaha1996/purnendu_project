        <p>1873â€“1900: Horse-drawn trams Life-size model of a horse-drawn tram at the City Centre arcade
            The first horse-drawn trams in India ran for 2.4 miles (3.9 km) between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street on 24
            February 1873. The service was discontinued on 20 November of that year. Metre-gauge horse-drawn tram tracks
            were laid from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat via Bowbazar Street, Dalhousie Square and Strand Road.
            Two years later, lines to Shibpur via G.T. Road were laid and the Esplanade to Sealdah station (via Moula Ali
            Junction), Moula Ali Junction to Nonapukur, Wattganj Junction to Jatin Das Park Junction (via Alipur) and
            Mominpur Junction to Behala routes opened. In 1930, the Park Circus line was extended to Garhiahat Junction. The
            Rajabazar line was extended to Galiff Street in 1941. In February 1943, the Calcutta and Howrah sections were
            connected by the new Howrah Bridge. With this extension, total track length reached 42.0 miles (67.59 km).
