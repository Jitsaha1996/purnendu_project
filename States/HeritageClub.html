            <P>In 1929, George Macy founded the Limited Editions Club and began publishing illustrated books in limited
                numbers (usually 1500 copies) for subscription members. In 1935 Macy founded the Heritage Club, which
                together with the Heritage Press, created and distributed more affordable and unlimited reprints of the
                great books previously published by The Limited Editions Club.
                He also authored The Collected Verses of George Jester (distributed in a limited number as a Macy family
                holiday greeting) and edited Heritage's A Sailor's Reader and A Soldier's Reader, which were wartime
                volumes, published in August 1943, of "four hundred thousand words of literary entertainment" for members of
                the American armed services.
    
                Macy also acquired and operated another press publishing limited editions. In 1936, he became managing
                director of the Nonesuch Press of London, founded by Francis Meynell.
    
                The Macy family sold their companies in 1970; Heritage Press was later sold to Easton Press.</P>
