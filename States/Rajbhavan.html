    <p>HRaj Bhavan Kolkata, also known as Government House, stands as a testament to Kolkata's colonial history and
        architectural grandeur. Nestled in the heart of B.B.D. Bagh, near the scenic banks of the Hooghly River, this
        majestic structure serves as the official residence and administrative headquarters of the Governor of West
        Bengal.</p>
