        <p>The Writers' Building often shortened to just Writers', is the secretariat building of the State Government of
            West Bengal in India. It is located in West Bengal's capital city of Kolkata. The 150-meter long Writers'
            Building covers the entire northern stretch of the a water body locally called Lal Dighi in the B.B.D. Bagh
            area.
    
            This originally served as the office for writers of the British East India Company, hence the name. Designed by
            Thomas Lyon in 1777, the Writers' Building has gone through several extensions over the years. It housed the
            office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal until 4 October 2013.
            The Writers' Building was designed by Thomas Lyon in 1777 for the British East India Company. In 1821 a 128
            ft-long verandah with Ionic columns, each 32 ft high, were added on the first and second floors. From 1889 to
            1906 two new blocks were added, approached by iron staircases that are still in use. Writers' acquired its
            Greco-Roman look, complete with the portico in the central bay and the red surface of exposed brick. The parapet
            was put in place and the statues sculpted by William Fredric Woodington in 1883, that line the terrace, were
            installed.
